1,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV), the non-response errors, the imputation errors, and subject matter expertise: A – Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D – Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish."
2,"Industry estimates are based on the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects/standard/naics/2022/v1/index" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Version 1.0 (opens new window)</a>. The following categories are excluded from the survey: 'Religious organizations' (8131) within 'Religious, grant-making, civic, and professional and similar organizations' (813), 'Private households' (814), 'Federal, government public administration' (911), 'Provincial and territorial public administration' (912) and 'International and other extra-territorial public administration' (919)."
3,"Due to the reduced sample size in the first quarter of 2015, the Finance and insurance (52) and Management of companies and enterprises (55) sectors were calibrated to a combined total from the <a href="http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=2612" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (opens new window)</a> for the first quarter of 2015 only."
4,"Excludes "Religious organizations" (8131) within "Religious, grant-making, civic, and professional and similar organizations" (813) as well as "Private households" (814)."
5,"Excludes "Federal, government public administration" (911), "Provincial and territorial public administration" (912) and "International and other extra-territorial public administration" (919)."
6,"A job is vacant if it meets the following conditions: it is vacant on the reference date (first day of the month) or will become vacant during the month; there are tasks to be carried out during the month for the job in question; and the employer is actively seeking a worker outside the organization to fill the job. The jobs could be full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, casual, or seasonal. Jobs reserved for subcontractors, external consultants, or other workers who are not considered employees, are excluded."
7,"The "employee" concept used in the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) is comprised of full-time employees, part-time employees, as well as permanent, casual, temporary, and seasonal employees. It also includes working owners, directors, partners, and other officers of incorporated businesses, as well as employees who work at home or on the road but report to the location. The "employee" concept used in the JVWS is meant to exclude owners or partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, the self-employed, subcontractors, external consultants, unpaid family workers, persons working outside Canada, and military personnel. It also excludes employees on unpaid leave, such as those on extended sick leave who are receiving insurance benefits."
8,"The job vacancy rate is the number of job vacancies expressed as a percentage of labour demand; that is, all occupied and vacant jobs."
9,"Data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to some Statistics Canada operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic."
